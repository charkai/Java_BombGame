# java_bombgame
A java project designing a popup game. 

This game was another that I made in my second year that I was very proud of. It presented my first real interactions with gradle, json, Processing library, and many other features of Java. 

I would recommend running the game just using 
```
gradle run
```
As gradle build will run a series of end to end tests created during development which can take a long time. As you may notice in the build.gradle file, in returning to this assignment I realised that there are issues with compatibility between Processing and more modern versions of Java running on my Mac, so I have forced JDK version 1.8 to be used. 

Due to the fact that the university assignment provided sprites, I actually used Pixsel to create sprites of my own to use so that I did not use any intellectual property of the university.

To play the game, press space to place bombs which can be used to destroy the broken walls on the map. Don't get caught in the explosion or by the enemies! Proceed to the tile with the medal to win. You have 3 lives and 180 seconds to complete this.
